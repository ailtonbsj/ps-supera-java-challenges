# Third Challenge

Given an array of integers and a target value, determine the numbers pairs between array element wherein the difference is equal to target value.
For example k = 1 and arr = [1, 2, 3, 4] there is 3 values which the difference is equal to target value k:
```
2 - 1 = 1
3 - 2 = 1
4 - 3 = 1
```

The pairs have the following parameters:
```
int k: an integer, the target value.
int arr[n]: an array of integer.
```


## Input

Your code need to contain two inputs n and k that represent the length of array and the target.
Your code should have an array of integers with length n.

## Output

Return the number of pairs that satisfy the criteria.

## Example

Input for n = 5, k =2, arr = [1, 5, 3, 4, 2]:
```
5 2
1 5 3 4 2
```

Output:
```
3
```
